        <h2>First Paragraph</h2>
        Rickrolling, alternatively Rick-rolling or Rickroll, is a prank and an Internet meme involving an unexpected
        appearance of the music video for the 1987 song "Never Gonna Give You Up," performed by the English singer
        Rick
        Astley. The meme is a type of bait and switch using a disguised hyperlink that leads to the music video.
        When
        victims click on a seemingly unrelated link, the site with the music video loads instead of what was
        expected,
        and they have been "Rickrolled". The meme has also extended to using the song's lyrics, or singing it, in
        unexpected contexts. Astley himself has also been Rickrolled several times.

            <h2>Second Paragraph</h2>
            The meme grew out of a similar bait-and-switch trick called "duck rolling" that was popular on the 4chan
            website in 2006. The video bait-and-switch trick grew popular on 4chan by 2007 April Fools' Day and spread
            to other Internet sites later that year. The meme gained mainstream attention in 2008 through several
            publicized events, particularly when YouTube used it on its 2008 April Fools' Day event.

            <h2>Third Paragraph</h2>
            Rickrolling started to appear in more mainstream sources during 2008, with a
            SurveyUSA
            April 2008 poll estimating that at least 18 million US adults had been rickrolled.[10] One of the first
            public events involved the Church of Scientology, which had been aggressively trying to censor videos
            critical of the church. The Internet group Anonymous, as part of their Project Chanology to challenge this
            censoring, protested at the Church's various headquarters across the globe by chanting the song, among other
            activities.[11] A number of collegiate basketball games in March 2008 had people dressing up as Astley from
            the video and lip-syncing to the music as a prank before the start of the game.[12] YouTube's 2008 April
            Fools joke made featured video hyperlinks on the site's home page end up on the music video.[13][14] In
            April 2008, the New York Mets baseball team asked fans on the internet what song they should use for their
            eighth-inning rally song. "Never Gonna Give You Up" received a massive number of votes, driven by websites
            like 4chan.[15][14] At the 2008 MTV Europe Music Awards, an online campaign led to Astley being named
            the "Best Act Ever" despite not being on the original shortlist of nominees, effectively rickrolling the
            awards.
